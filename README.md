## Crypto Tracker
This application pulls data of cryptocurrencies from a proxy endpoint and displays 10 coins that can be removed or added to a table.

## How to use?
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
Given the proxy client, it would be ideal to use an incognito page.
